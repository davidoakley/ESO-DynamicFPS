# Dynamic FPS - an ESO addon #
This is a small, lightweight addon that will vary ESO's maximum frame rate (often called Max FPS), primarily to save power and reduce heat generation when you are idle, but also to give quicker screen updates when you are in combat.

## Please Note ##

This addon is brand-new, and has only been tested by me! **Please don't use this addon if you're not comfortable fixing your MinFrameRate (below) if things go wrong!** I would appreciate friendly feedback as to how it can be improved or how it isn't working the way you'd expect.

The ability to actually change the max FPS depends on the capabilities of your monitor, your graphics card, your OS and the game itself! If you find that the FPS doesn't change when the game is idle, I'm afraid you'll have to find guides on the internet - I hope to add some links to these at some point.

The addon will always try and restore the game's maximum frame rate to the Fixed FPS setting before you log out or quit the game. If this doesn't happen and you disable the addon your game may get stuck with the last FPS that the addon used! In that case, re-enable Dynamic FPS, go into Settings and turn 'Dynamic FPS' off, before re-disabling the addon. You can also [fix the MinFrameTime setting in UserSettings.txt manually](https://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/discussion/584759/frame-rate-cap-adjustment-how-to-limit-your-fps-from-being-too-high-updated).

## Settings ##

![Settings](media/settings.jpg)

- **Enable dynamic FPS**: The addon starts in a disabled state; switch this ON to enable management of
the game's maximum FPS
- **Static FPS**: When dynamic FPS is OFF, the addon will set the maximum FPS to this value. ESO's default
is 100fps; 60fps is common for PC games

### Maximum Frame Rates ###

This is where you set the maximum FPS for each of the states that the addon detects.

- **Combat FPS**: when your character is in combat you can choose to increase the game's FPS to your
monitor's maximum FPS, or choose the highest setting that your graphics card can consistently run at
- **Active FPS**: this is the standard FPS for general adventuring. 60fps is a good choice for this
- **Idle FPS**: after you haven't moved your character or camera for some time, you can reduce the FPS.
30fps is the default, which reduces power and heat but is relatively smooth
- **AFK FPS**: once you have been idle for a significant time you can reduce the FPS further. 10fps
will make the game look 'choppy', but should significantly reduce energy and heat

### Other Settings ###

- **Show alerts**: If you want to make it more obvious when the addon changes state, this will post
an update to the top-right of the screen
- **Enable logging**: if LibDebugLogger is installed, Dynamic FPS can output messages about the events it is receiving and the state changes it makes

## Chat Box 'Slash' Commands ##

You can use the following commands:
- `/dfps`: Open Dynamic FPS Settings
- `/dfps on`: Enable Dynamic FPS
- `/dfps off`: Disable Dynamic FPS - this will use the 'Fixed FPS' instead
- `/dfps logging on`: Enable logging
- `/dfps logging off`: Disable logging
