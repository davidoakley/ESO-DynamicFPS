This is a small, lightweight AddOn that will vary your game's monitor refresh rate (often called
FPS - frames per second), primarily to save power when you are idle, but also to maximise the refresh
rate when you are in combat.

## Please Note ##

The ability to change your monitor's refresh rate depends on the capabilities of your monitor, your
graphics card, Windows and ESO itself! If you find that the FPS doesn't change when the game is idle,
I'm afraid you'll have to find guides on the internet - I hope to add some links to these at some point.

This AddOn is brand-new, and has only been tested by me! I would appreciate friendly feedback as to how
it can be improved or how it isn't working the way you'd expect.

## Features ##

- Four FPS settings for different game states
    - **Active**: this is the standard FPS for general adventuring
    - **Combat**: when your character is in combat you can choose to increase the game's FPS
    - **Idle**: after you haven't moved your character or camera for some time, you can reduce the FPS
    - **AFK**: once you have been idle for a significant time you can reduce the FPS further
- Configurable timeouts for idle and AFK modes
- Colour the FPS counter to show the FPS Manager's current state
- Show in the top-right corner of the screen when FPS Manager changes states
